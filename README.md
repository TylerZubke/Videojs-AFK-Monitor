# Videojs-AFK-Monitor
A plugin for VideoJS that is similar to Netflix's "Are you still watching?" 
Watches the 'useractive' and 'userinactive' events from VideoJS. After a certain period of inactivity a popup will display asking the user if they are still watching. If the user doesn't answer after a specified period of time, the player is automatically paused.

## How to use
Load VideoJS (http://videojs.com/) somewhere before the plugin JS file.
It can be loaded via CDN with 
```
<script src="http://vjs.zencdn.net/5.4.4/video.js"></script>
```
Load the CSS in the head tag
```
<link href="videojs.afk-monitor.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Load the JS just before the close of the body tag
```
<script src="videojs.afk-monitor.min.js"></script>
```
Add the plugin to your VideoJS player (replace 'my-video' with whatever your player's ID is) 
and pass in an object of any options you wish to override.
```
<script type="text/javascript">
    var video = videojs('my-video');
    video.AFKMonitor();
</script>
```
